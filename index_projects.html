                <h3>My Diabetes Diary</h3>
                <p> As a Type 1 Diabetic keeping a log of blood glucose or meals can be difficult. I looked through and downloaded many free apps before deciding
                    that I would try to create one myself. My Diabetes Diary was meant to help me make notes about my eating habits, blood glucose levels and even settings
                    for my insuling pump.

                <h3>Tea Cozy Webpage</h3>
                <p>Tea Cozy is a project from Codecademy's online course. The purpose of the excercise was to create a webpage based off of a provided template. 
                    The major lesson for this project was the use of div elements and flex display. This page was created before learning about media queries for smaller screens
                    or breakpoints and is best viewed on a larger screen.

                <h3>NaR Environmental Webpage</h3>
                <p> This webpage was created as a project for Codecademy in a project that only specified to create a webpage for any real or made up business. Unlike previous projects
                    the NaR webpage uses media queries to add or remove images and change text sizes for different size screens.
                    <br>
                    NaR Environmental Ltd. is a real vegitation management company located in Northern Alberta.  </p>

                <h3>Mixed Messages Web Application</h3>
                <p>Mixed Messages is the first project in the Codecademy Full Stack Enineering course that incorporates Javascript. For this project the specification was to 
                    create a randomly generated message that would either be printed in the console or could be shown in a web app. The message had to consist of three portions in order
                    to truly be randomly generated. The idea of my project was to create different t-shirt designs (red and green stripes for example) and display the pattern and the chosen
                    colors in a web application.
