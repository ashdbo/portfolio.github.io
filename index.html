                <h2> About Me</h2>
                <p> Hello! My name is Ashly, or Ashdbo for most online purposes. I graduated from Chemical Engineering in Alberta, Canada in 2017 
                    but ended up working customer service jobs for years before deciding it was time to work towards a new career path. I took
                    an Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard in 2020 and created my first project using Java 
                    called My Diabetes Diary. Although it was never released or used by anyone aside from myself it helped
                    me to dive into the world of programming. I am currently taking Codecadey's pro level course for
                    Full-Stack Engineering to gain a more indepth knowledge of web applications. 
                </p>
